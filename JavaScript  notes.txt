                                                      JavaScript Course Notes of every video
  

Video No.1 

     In this video I learned about Client Side and server side. I learned how can you run javascript
     in console in your browser like open your console and enter" alert('hello') ". It will prompt an
     alert and we learned about console.log('String your want to enter')it prints the string in the 
     console. Installed Visual Studio Code and we ran some more in-browser javascript in the console like 
     document.getElementsByClassName etc. 


Video No.2
     In this video I learned that we can run run javascript by writing it in a  different file. 
     Learned about different datatypes. Learned about consle.table({eman:"harry",marks:"fifty"})
     and console.warn() and it prints a warning in the console. console.clear() : it clears the 
     console. Learned about console.time() and console.timeEnd() when your wanna see how much time it
     took you to complete a certain number of lines of code and after that learned about 
     console.assert(condition, "string you wanna enter"). It returns an error when the condition returns
     false.

Video No.3
     In this video I learned about variables. Variable Declaration and variable assigning. var , let , const are 
     used to declare variables in javascript.	We learned rules for creating variables in javascript.
     Rules :
                   1 Cannot start with numbers
                   2 Variable names cannot contain spaces.
                   3 Variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).]
                   4 Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
                   5 Variable names are case-sensitive.

     let has a block level scope If you define a variable without using these then the global variable is 
     Common Case types
     overwritten even inside a block and you cannot reassign the value to a const. After that I learned about most 
    
                                  The most common Case types in Javascript  
                                 
                      camelCase           kebab-case           snake_case            PascalCase

Video No.4
     Starting this video by learning about datatypes Two types of datatypes in javascript. First is 
     Primitive and Reference datatypes. In primitive datatypes memory allocation is in stack and in reference it
     is in heap.
                       Primitive Datatypes String, numbers, boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol
                       Reference Datatypes Arrays, object literals, functions and dates	
     And we learned about typeof function and the types of many datatypes. Null is a primitive but its type 
     is object. Made the first function in javascript and made a date function.
Video No.5
     This video is about Type Conversion and type coercion. Learned about string() function. It is used to 
     convert a number to string. When any datatype is converted to a string then its functions can be applied
     on it and vice versa. Learned about Number() function and ParseInt(). They are both the same but when 
     parseInt when given a decimal gives an integer for example parseInt(3.44343) it returns 34 but Number()
     returns the exact value as 3.44343. PareseFloat does the same thing too. There is another function 
     .tofixed() it returns given number decimal points.	
Video No.6
     This video is about string properties and methods. So string functions in javascript are:
        Be careful that it does not change the original string
           it just returns it.
       let html = "This is just for fun " 
      ------- html = html.concat("this");         /// html.concat("this"); console.log(html); this won't work
       console.log(html)   /////  Console (This is just for fun this)
      ------- html.toLowerCase();
      ------- html.toUpperCase();
      ------- html.length;
      ------- html.indexof();
      ------- html.lastIndexOf();
      ------- html.charAt();
      ------- html.endsWith();
      ------- html.includes();
      ------- html.substring(0,3); it gives you the characters starting from 0 to n-1.
      ------- html.slice(-4)
      ------- html.split(' '); It returns the string as an array.
      ------- html.replace("this","This");
      And then comes template Literals. Template Literals are like this 
          let name = "Eman";
          html = `This is a heading ${name}.`
      
Video No.7 
       This video is about Array methods and properties. You can also make an array like this 
       const arr = new Array(23,4,5,67,6,"Orange");
       The length of an array starts from 1 but its index starts from 0.
       Methods and properties
     --  Array.isArray();
     --  Array.indexOf();	
        Now be careful because it changes the original array.
     --  Array.push(); It is pushed in the end of the array.
     --  Array.unshift(); It is pushed in the starting of the array.
     --  Array.pop(); It removes an element fromm the ending of the array.
     --  Array.shift(); It removes an element from the starting of the array.
     --  Array.splice(1,2); It removes 2 elements starting from 1st element excluding the 1st element.
     --  Array.reverse(); It reverses the whole array. 	
         Then leaned about objects and how to access its elements and ending the video now.
Video No.8
       In this video we are gonna talk about If-else statements and switches in javascript. I already know
       everything about if-else statements. So now about switches.Switch case statements are not used that
       much so just learn it for the concept.
Video No.9 
       This video is about for,while and dowhile loops. Whenver we want to repeat something we use loops.
       For example, for (let i=0;i<100;i++){
                                 console.log(i); }	First, the i is initialized as 0 and the condition is 
       checked if its true then the loop is ran one time then it is updated i++ then it is ran the same way 
       until the condition becomes false. Learned about forEach loop to print the elements of an array.
       How to print and object: 
                        for(let key in obj){
                                            console.log(obj[key])            }
                    Ending the video now.
Video No.10
       This video is about the concept of functions in javascript. Also gonna learn about the concept of 
       Scope in javascript. It is an important video. So first functions.Already know about functions 
       pretty much everything.	
      We can write a function like this :
   
          function funct(param1,param2) {
             let val = param1 + param2;
             return val;
         }
          and call it like this:
                  console.log(funct(2,4));       //This prints to the console 6 the sum of 2 and 4.

         This is also a valid syntax  :
                   const greet = function (param1,param2){
                           let val = param1 + param2;
                           return val;}         // It returns the same thing.


               Scope in javascript: let and const have block level scope and var has function level scope.
               This means if a variable i is defined inside an if statement with var and you console it 
               outside the block it will not give and error but if you assign it with a let it will give an
               error that i is not defined.That's because let has block level scope and var has function level
               or global scope.

Video No.11	
         This video is about manipulating websites with js window object.
                    If you           let a = window;
                                     console.log(a); It will show you all window funcitons.
         For example, If you write window.innerHeight; It will tell you the inner height of the window.
         Likewise, there is innerWidth; Another function is scrollX and scrollY;It tells you how much have
         you scrolled in X or Y.Another function is location.reload(); It reloads the page.
         Another function is location.href. You can assign it any webpage and your page will go to that page.
         Another function is window.history; So if you write history.go(-1) so it will reload you to your previous 
         page where you were before.

Video No.12
         This video is about understanding DOM more.If you type document.all it gives you all the tags 
         that you have used in your website.If there is a form then type document.form it gives you all 
         forms in  your website.Learned about Array.from(a).forEach(function(element){ conosole.log(element)})
         It makes and array from it.Another document.links gives you all the links in the html page.
         document.scripts and document.images are useful too.
Video No.13
         This is exercie no.1 in javascript : WebPage Crawler.
Video No.14
         This video is about DOM Selectors in javascript. There are two types of DOM Selectors in javascript.
         Single element selectors and Multi element selectors. 
         let elem = document.getElementById('idname')
         elem.className;
         elem.childNodes;
         elem.parentNode;
         elem.style.color = "red";
         elem.innerText = "Text you wanna add.";
         elem.innerHtml = "Html that you wanna add.";
              document.querySelector() is also an element selector. You can also give it a tag or class or id.
         Multi element selector:
           document.getElementsByClassName(); document.getElementsByTagName();
         
Video No.15
         This video is about Traversing the DOM and Children,Parent in javascript. Learned about Child Nodes and 
         children childNodes returns everthing including comments and spaces. We should use children.Also 
         nodeName returns the nodename and nodetype returns the node's type. 1 for element 2 attribute 3 text node
         8 comment 9 document 10 doctype.Another is firstChild it returns the first child but dont use it becuase 
         it will count the spaces. Instead use firstElementChild.Another is ChildElementCount It returns the count
         of child elements.Likewise When we use nextSibling it returns the very next sibling if there is a space 
         it will return text. So use nextElementSibling instead.

Video No.16
         This video is about Creating,removing and replacing elements.First to create and element :
         let elem = document.createElement('li'); To add a class and id :
         elem.className = "liclass"; elem.id = "lid"; Set any attribute by this function. For example,
         elem.setAttribute("title","mytitle"); Adding some text to it: elem.innerText = "This is an li5";
         Now appending it to an element present in the DOM in this case ul.
         let ul = document.querySelector('ul');ul.appendChild(elem);
         You can also add a text like this : document.createTextNode("I am a text node.")
         How to replace and element You can use this: element.replaceWith(Elementyouwannaadd);
         You can also replace a child with replaceChild(Child you wanna add,Element you wanna replace with);
         For example, myul.replaceChild(elem2,document.getElementById('fui')); You can also remove the child
         with removechild(); Also elem.getAttribute('id'). It gives you the id of that element.  Also if you 
         wanna see that an element has an attribute or not. You can use elem.hasAttribute('class').
         You can remove it by using elem.removeAttribute('class'); Harry bhai also gave a quick quiz at 
         the end of the video.
Video No.17
         This video is about the Event object and handling events in javascrpt. You can call an event like this
         h.addEventListener('click',function(e){
         console.log("You have clicked the headng." ,e);}) There are many types of events. One of them is Click.
         e.target gives you what you cliked. A property e.target.classList gives you the list of the classes in
         the target you are clicking. Another is e.offsetX. It will tell you where have you clicked relative to
         the element.Similarly there is OffsetY.There is also ClientX and ClientY it gives you relative to the 
         browser window. 
         Another event is mouseover.
                                         Ending the video . // The next video is also about the event object
         and more on javascript events.
Video No.18
          So, again on events.First things is that the default behaviour of a form is that it submits the form. 
          So, to prevent that we use e.preventDefault() function.So another event is dblclick.Anothe is mousedown
          Even if you right click on it or click with the  mouse wheel, the event will fire itself.There are two
          more which include mouseenter and mouseleave.Likewise, there is mousemove event.
Video No.19
          This video was the solution of the exercise 1.
Video No.20
          This video is about local and session storage. Its an important concept in javascript.If you type in the
          console window.localStorage; The console will show you the storage. You can store items in it like this
          localStorage.setItem("firstKey","value"); To get an item localStorage.getItem("firstKey");
          localStorage.clear() clears the entire localStorage. You cannot add arrays in local storage. But we are 
          going to see how can we add and array to local storage. You can use JSON.stringify(array) and when you 
          wanna retrieve that value use JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('Key'));
